# Introduction
In this data analysis we used the data from the NOAA Storm Database to answer two major questions:
- Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health? and
- Which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

In our analysis we use tools like graphs, tables and summaries to gain some insight about the data and columns that we will use later, after that, we created two datasets called healthDamage and economicDmg which will allow us to answer the questions in a conclusive form.
